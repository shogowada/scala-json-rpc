# scala-json-rpc

Make communication between your server and client as easy as making function calls!

scala-json-rpc is a [Remove Procedure Call (RPC)](remote procedure call) library for Scala JVM/JS following [JSON-RPC 2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) spec. **It has no dependency** and should fit into any of your Scala JVM/JS application.

If you don't know what JSON-RPC is, don't worry. Using this library, you can achieve RPC without knowing much details; all you have to do is to make sure generated string is passed to server and client.

The library has no opinion about how the string should be passed between server and client, so you can achieve RPC over [HTTP](examples/e2e), [WebSocket](examples/e2eWebSocket), TCP socket, or whatever, as long as it is capable of passing strings.

|Component|SBT|Scala Version|Scala JS Version|
|---|---|---|---|
|scala-json-rpc|```"io.github.shogowada" %%% "scala-json-rpc" % "0.3.0"```|2.11, 2.12|0.6|

It supports the following features:

- Send/receive JSON-RPC request
- [Send/receive JSON-RPC notification](/examples/notification)
- Respond [standard JSON-RPC error](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object)
- [Define custom JSON serialization](/examples/customJsonSerialization)
- [Define custom JSON-RPC method name](/examples/customMethodName)

We have the following example projects for common use cases:

- [Unidirectional JSON-RPC from Scala JS to Scala JVM over HTTP](examples/e2e)
- [Bidirectional JSON-RPC between Scals JS and Scala JVM over WebSocket](examples/e2eWebSocket)

It should already serve you well as a RPC library, but it still does not fully support JSON-RPC spec yet. Here are list of known JSON-RPC features that's not supported yet.

- Send/receive named parameter
    - Define custom parameter name
- Send/receive custom JSON-RPC error
- Define custom JSON-RPC request ID

# Quick Look

In this example, we will implement calculator on server side and call the calculator methods from client side.

## Shared

### Define APIs

API traits are shared between server and client.

Server uses it to implement the API, while client uses it to create a client for the API that calls server and returns result.

```scala
// Note that API methods must return either Future or Unit type.
// If the method returns Future, it will be JSON-RPC request method, and client can receive response.
trait CalculatorApi {
  def add(lhs: Int, rhs: Int): Future[Int]
  def subtract(lhs: Int, rhs: Int): Future[Int]
}

// If the method returns Unit, it will be JSON-RPC notification method, and client does not receive response.
trait LoggerApi {
  def log(message: String): Unit
}
```

### Define JSON serialization/deserialization method

If you just want it to work, you can also use [upickle-json-serializer](/upickle-json-serializer) as your ```JsonSerializer``` instead of [implementing it by yourself](/examples/customJsonSerialization).

```scala
class MyJsonSerializer extends JsonSerializer {
  override def serialize[T](value: T): Option[String] = // ... Serialize model into JSON.
  override def deserialize[T](json: String): Option[T] = // ... Deserialize JSON into model.
}

val jsonSerializer = new MyJsonSerializer()

// Or, if you just want it to work, use UpickleJsonSerializer.

val jsonSerializer = UpickleJsonSerializer()
```

## Server side

```scala
// Implement the APIs.
class CalculatorApiImpl extends CalculatorApi {
  override def add(lhs: Int, rhs: Int): Future[Int] = Future(lhs + rhs)
  override def subtract(lhs: Int, rhs: Int): Future[Int] = Future(lhs - rhs)
}

class LoggerApiImpl extends LoggerApi {
  override def log(message: String): Unit = println(message)
}

// Create JSON-RPC server.
val jsonSerializer = new MyJsonSerializer()
val server = JsonRpcServer(jsonSerializer)

// Bind as many APIs as you want.
server.bindApi[CalculatorApi](new CalculatorApiImpl)
server.bindApi[LoggerApi](new LoggerApiImpl)

// Feed JSON-RPC request into server and send its response to client.
// The library makes sure to call the right method with right parameters.
// It gives you result as Future[Option[String]], where the String is JSON-RPC response.
// If the response is present, you are supposed to send it back to client.
val requestJson: String = // ... JSON-RPC request as JSON. This is generated by and passed from client.
val futureMaybeResponse: Future[Option[String]] = server.receive(requestJson)
futureMaybeResponse.onComplete {
  case Success(Some(responseJson)) => // Send the response to client.
  case Success(None) => // Response is absent if it was JSON-RPC notification (API method returning Unit), but it was still a successful RPC.
  case _ =>
}
```

## Client side

```scala
// Create JSON-RPC client.
val jsonSerializer = new MyJsonSerializer()
val jsonSender: (String) => Future[Option[String]] = (requestJson) => {
  // By returning the future response here, it will automatically take care of the responses for you.
  val futureMaybeResponseJson: Future[Option[String]] = // ... Send the request JSON and receive its response.
  futureMaybeResponseJson
}
val client = JsonRpcClient(jsonSerializer, jsonSender)

// Create as many APIs as you want.
// Client APIs are implemented by the library, so all you need to do is to pass the trait type.
val calculatorApi: CalculatorApi = client.createApi[CalculatorApi]
val loggerApi: LoggerApi = client.createApi[LoggerApi]

// Use the API.
// When you invoke a client API method, the library makes sure to reach out to server and return the result.
val futureResult: Future[Int] = calculatorApi.add(1, 2)
futureResult.onComplete {
  case Success(result) => // ... Do something with the result.
  case _ =>
}

loggerApi.log("I've just made RPC without pain!")
```

Alternatively, you can feed JSON-RPC responses explicitly like below. You can use whichever flow makes more sense for your application. For example, if you are using WebSocket to connect client and server, this flow might make more sense than to return future response from the JSON sender.

```scala
val jsonSender: (String) => Future[Option[String]] = (requestJson) => {
  // If client doesn't have access to the future response now, you can explicitly feed the response like below too.
  // ...
  Future(None)
}
// ...
client.receive(responseJson) // Explicitly feed JSON-RPC responses.
```
